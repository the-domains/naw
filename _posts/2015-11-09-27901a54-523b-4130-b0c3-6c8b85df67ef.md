So this is the grid! After months of chatter (or lack of it in some cases) the activation email has arrived. Sign up was reassuringly straight forward and within seconds I'm posting. Clearly I need to think up a decent site name but its so easy to get caught up on the details, this time I thought I'd just dive in and see what I could do.  Fortunately its a rainy November Monday morning and I've got an hour to kill, the perfect time to explore the beta and get my feet wet  without setting foot outside.
